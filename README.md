# Description

This tool helps you to **remove all comments** in a python script.

As usually, I wrote everything you have to know, directly commentend in the scripts.

You have 2 versions :

* Simple script (so you will have to change path(s) inside ).

* With GUI (graphical interface) using PyQT5, so easy to make a smartphone application if you need.


I made both because the 2 scripts allows you to remove comments on ONLY ONE FILE.py , so you will maybe change the function to use it for lot of files.

# HOW TO RUN ;

This tutorial is made for wndows users.

Because this script has no official signature it could be detected as a malware so I made 3 versions who show you it's safu.


## 1. Just click on silence.exe from the latest release

The first .exe file is a portable version made for windows 10 with auto-py-to-exe.

In the zipped folder named Silence you'll have the same exectuable with its directory for more transparency.

## 2. Launch with Python

If you want to launch it with python You will need the ico folder in same folder where is the script you want to launch .


## 3. Compile yourself the python script ;

- [ ] 1. Download python, icon folder and the script in "app"

- [ ] 2. Compile the file yourself :

Now you will need auto-py-to-exe, here's the link https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/#description

You just have to click on the autopytoexe.py after the download and follow instructions, don't forget to add sad.png by tick additionnal files or it will not work.

Also you can obviously compile it from another way but I suppose auto-py-to-exe is the fastest and easiest way.

Here is an example of paremeters you can change :
